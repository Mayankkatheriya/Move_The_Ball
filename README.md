## Explanation:
This code creates a simple web application that allows users to move a ball using arrow keys. Here's a summary in 8-10 lines:

`HTML`:

* The HTML sets up a webpage with a title, a div element with the id "ball," and a reference to an external CSS file and JavaScript file.

`CSS`:

* The CSS defines styles for the webpage background and the "ball" div.
* It sets the background image and size and applies styles to the ball, like its size, shape, position, background gradient, color, and box-shadow.

`JavaScript`:

* The JavaScript code selects the "ball" element and listens for keyboard events (arrow keys).
* It keeps track of the ball's top and left positions and its rotation angle.
* When arrow keys are pressed, it moves the ball within the boundaries of the viewport, adjusting the top, left, and rotation accordingly.

In summary, this web application lets users control the movement of a ball using arrow keys. The ball moves within the browser viewport and changes its rotation angle as it moves left or right. The background provides a visually appealing design.
